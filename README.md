# Income Classification using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on classifying income levels using three variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm: **MultinomialNB**, **GaussianNB**, and **BernoulliNB**, implemented using **scikit-learn**. The goal is to analyze and compare their performance on structured tabular income data.
